# 🌟 Role-Based Access Control System (RBAC)  

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System** with three user roles:  

- **Super Admin** 🏆 – Has access to register user, admin and other super-admins.  
- **Admin** 🔧 – Has access to register user and view their posts.
- **User** 👤 – Can access posts and create posts functionality.  

The system consists of two parts:
